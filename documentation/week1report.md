# Week 1 report

Hours used this week: 5

This week I started my project. I chose to make a minesweeper bot that helps a player to win a minesweeper game. It was one of the suggested topics. I also found it interesting since I made a minesweeper game myself in this other couse not so long ago.

This week I concentrated on reading the instructions of the course. I have been sick for almost two weeks now but now I feel good enough to get back on track with my studies. A little bit late for this week's deadline but it can't be helped. Luckily Labtool and github and the required documentation are mostly the same kind as in the software development methods course so I can focus more on other things on this course.

I have been wondering if the bot should use a backtracking algorithm. And how I can make the algorithm perform faster. When I'm playing minesweeper I usually start with opened squares with the number "1" written on them so there is only one mine in one of the neighbouring squares. And specifically those opened squares that have only one unopened neigbouring square. Because in those squares it is 100 % certain that there is a mine. Then I look at the other neighbouring opened squares of this mine square.

But I think I need to dig much more in this topic and search for clues on how to solve this problem with an algorithm.
