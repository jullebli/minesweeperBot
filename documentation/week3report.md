# Week 3 report

Hours used this week: 13

This week I didn't have so much time for this project. I started my week with solving the problems with SecondBot's AMN and AFN algorithms. Now they seem to work as they should. It was hard to implement Becerra's pseudocode algorithm (Double set single point) to the minesweeperBot base. Then I started searching information about constraint problem solving. I found some good examples about them. But I don't think that I have enough skills or help to be able to make CSP algortihm.

I corrected some checkstyle errors. I didn't know that you should avoid "nested blocks". I'm having problems with testing, it seems a little bit different than with Maven project. After hours I finally found out where I can see the print from tests. Now I need to figure out how to make the same board again and again for all of the tests and how to test SecondBot's methods with it. I think I need to understand the code of the base material better. I tried asking help from the teacher but I guess I need to wait until we can schedule a Zoom meeting. 

I have learned something about Gradle projects but I know this project would have been easier if I could use Maven again. I need to make my algorithm faster by speeding up the handling of squares numbered 0 (after opening). I found some help to Gradle but I'm missing something, even though I use a seed to make a game sometimes the board is different. When a seed is used then it should always be the same. I found advice how to make a jar from gradle project but that is not working as well.

Next I need to figure out if I will do the CSP algorithm or something else with this project. But what?
