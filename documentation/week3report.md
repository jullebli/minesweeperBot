# Week 3 report

Hours used this week: 10

This week I didn't have so much time for this course. I started my week with solving the problems with SeconBot's AMN and AFN. Now they seem to work as they should. It was hard to implement Becerra's pseudocode algorithm (Double set single point) to the minesweeperBot base. After this I started searching information about constraint problem solving. I found some good examples about them.
