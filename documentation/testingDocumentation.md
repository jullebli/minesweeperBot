# Documentation for testing

The bots have been tested manually and checked that they function as they should be. A lot of prints have been added to help manual testing. At the moment the bot does not do random opening of squares. If the bot cannot determine a safe square to open, then it will start toggling a flag in the right bottom corner. This indicates the tester that the bot thinks that there are no safe moves left to do.

There will also be some some JUnit testing for bots.
