# Minesweeper bot

A minesweeper solver/helper made in the course DATA STRUCTURES PROJECT (4 CR). The implementation code of the minesweeper game has not been made by me. It was offered as a base to help develope the solver/helper and has been made by other students on another course. My work/code consists of the bot imlementations: FirstBot and SecondBot and their tests.
